<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Simracing Valley]](https://github.com/rmlz/simracingvalley)

This is the source code of a very personal project that I worked in the 2017-2018 years. Now anyone can create your own "Player aggregator" for the Reiza's [Game-Automobilista](http://www.game-automobilista.com/br/) simulator.

This code is totally prepared to be uploaded on [AMAZON-AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/)! All you need to do is to ZIP it and upload it into your own server!

I'll not teach how to edit the code. It's important that you know some python, and that you have the will to learn and create your own system. It's also known that you know some mongodb, or at least how to translate the mongodb queries to a SQL format inside the code and implement your own SQL database.

If you have any doubt about the code, I may help you as I'm not creating a full documentation. Just open an [issue](https://github.com/rmlz/simracingvalley/issues)!

Servercontrol.py contains the "automation bot" that will start servers, save race data to database and finish it. **This way you can save an entire agenda of automated servers that will start and end after saving racing results!** It's just **AWESOME!!**

### Features
* Player account and personal profile;
* Accounts are STEAM-linked;
* Ranking;
* Races logs and records;
* Driver's evolution through season;
* Dedicated server menagement from website;
* Safe storage of personal data (encryption!);



### Built With

* [Python-Flask](https://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html)
* [AMAZON-AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/)
* [MONGO-DB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
* [Sublee's Trueskill](https://github.com/sublee/trueskill)

**Why am I opening the source code?** Well, I have no time to manage such a site like this! By opening the code I make my contribution available
to everyone which wants to study or implement the code inside their own projects!

I'm a Python student that have been trying to create useful scripts for the Simracing Community. 
Also I may thanks all the people that helped me to develop the Simracing Valley Community:
